the boys want nawaz to believe that the military will never approach to overthrow the government and its corrupt against pakistan . the media is running around the country and keeping their eyes on security policy . so what happened to hamid sharif ? why would nawaz give raheel another chance ? the boys know what the boys are really up to . but what they are saying is often dangerous because they are ready for failing to placate rivals , dreaming up fanciful schemes and ruling through what they want .
